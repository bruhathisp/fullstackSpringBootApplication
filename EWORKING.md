# Let's explain it in simple terms:

When you use JWT for authentication in your web application, the server gives you a special code (JWT) after you log in successfully. This code is like a ticket that proves you are allowed to access certain parts of the application.

Now, whenever you want to access something that requires you to prove who you are (like accessing your profile or posting a comment), you need to show this ticket (JWT) to the server.

To do that, you attach this ticket (JWT) to every request you send to the server. You put the ticket in a special place called the "Authorization header." It's like showing your ticket to the security guard before entering a restricted area.

The "Authorization header" has a specific structure. It starts with the word "Bearer" (which simply means "this is a special code"), followed by your actual ticket (the JWT) with a space in between.

So, every time you want to do something on the application that requires you to be logged in, you make sure to attach this "Bearer [JWT]" ticket to your request, and the server checks if it's valid. If the ticket is valid, you are allowed to do what you wanted, like view your profile or post a comment.

In this way, the server doesn't need to remember who you are for every request you make. It just checks your ticket (JWT) to see if you have permission to access the requested resources. This is what makes the application "stateless," as there's no need for the server to keep track of your session; the token (JWT) carries all the information needed.

# Let's go through the steps in detail:

1. Token Generation:
The backend is responsible for generating the JWT. This occurs when a user successfully logs in or registers on the web application. Once the user's identity is verified, the backend creates a JWT containing relevant information about the user, such as the user ID, first name, last name, roles, and an expiration date for the token.

2. Token Storage:
After the JWT is generated by the backend, it is sent back to the frontend and must be stored securely. A common place to store the JWT is in the browser's local storage. Local storage provides a way to store key-value pairs in the user's web browser and persists even if the browser is closed and reopened. Storing the JWT securely in the local storage ensures that the frontend can access it for future requests.

3. Sending the JWT in Requests:
For each subsequent request that requires authentication (e.g., accessing protected resources on the server), the frontend must include the JWT in the HTTP header, specifically in the Authorization header. The Authorization header has the following structure: "Bearer [JWT]". The word "Bearer" is a token type, indicating that the token being sent is a JWT. The actual JWT follows the word "Bearer" with a space.

4. Public and Authenticated Requests:
In the security configuration of the backend, the server must distinguish between public requests that do not require authentication (such as login and registration) and authenticated requests that need a valid JWT for access. The security configuration must permit anyone to access the public routes.

5. JWT Validation with Filter:
To ensure that each authenticated request contains a valid JWT, the backend uses a filter. This filter reads and parses the JWT sent in the Authorization header before reaching the controller that handles the request. The filter validates the token's integrity, checks its expiration date, and verifies that the user's identity is authentic. If the JWT is valid, the request proceeds to the appropriate controller for further processing.

By following these steps, the application achieves stateless authentication, as the backend does not store any session information. Instead, the client (frontend) manages the JWT, and the server validates it for each request. This approach is scalable, secure, and allows the frontend and backend to be developed independently. JSON Web Tokens have become a popular choice for authentication in modern web applications due to their flexibility and security.
